# Crafting Interpreters

A personal implementation of [*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom. This includes two implementations for the `lox` programming language: one in `Java` and another one focusing on performance in `C`. 

## Jlox (Chapters 1–13)

`Jlox` is the high-level language interpreter built using a tree-walk approach. It emphasizes readability and simplicity, guiding the foundational stages of language parsing, analysis, and execution.

Completed so far (up to Chapter 7):
- Scanner (lexical analysis)
- Parser (syntax analysis)
- Expression evaluation

Planned:
- Complete Jlox with tree-walk interpreter and runtime (Chapters 8–13)

---

## Clox (Chapters 14–30)

Next phase: building a bytecode virtual machine and compiler in `C` for the lox language (`Clox`).

Planned:
- Implement Clox VM and compiler following Chapters 14–30

This project reflects my passion for compiler engineering, language design, and systems programming, with ongoing progress as time allows.
