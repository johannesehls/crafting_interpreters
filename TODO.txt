Stuff one could add to the language:

- Integers?
- Typing
- bitwise, shift, modulo, or conditional operators
- do-while loops?
- for-in loops
- Transfer built-in types to real objects?
- std library: e.g. -> String manipulation, trigonometric functions, file I/O, networking, reading input from the user
- Error handling: Show user where exactly the error occurred in the source code! (^-- Here.)
    - Token needs more than just line number then...
    - ErrorReporter interface or similar: Passed to scanner / parser; enabling swapping out error reporting strategies
- Strings with escape sequences
